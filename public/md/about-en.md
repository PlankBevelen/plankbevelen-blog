# About Me

This is my personal tech blog. I focus on frontend engineering, backend practice, and product design, and I record useful technical notes and thoughts.

The site emphasizes simplicity: the home page shows the latest posts, categories, and a tag cloud. You can also use the search on article pages to quickly locate content.

Feel free to reach out or point out issues. If you enjoy a post, please share it with your friends.
